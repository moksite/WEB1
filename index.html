        <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>        
        <p>The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages.
          It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new markup language called HTML.
          Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links. They are written in HTML.The software to see the World Wide Web is called a Web browser.
          One also needs a connection to the Internet. Many companies nowadays offer limited website hosting allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the World Wide Web like any other domain (www.stuff.com) site. These sites usually make money from advertisements instead of fees.</p>
